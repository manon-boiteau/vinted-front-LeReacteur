⏳ Frontend part of Vinted (API already code)  
👀 Look at the backend repo!

## Welcome in my Vinted school project 🎒👗👟

Vinted is an online marketplace and community that allows its users to sell, buy and swap secondhand clothing items and accessories.

### My work?

To code the frontend of Vinted based on API we code in class:

- Home page
- Authentification (cookies)
- Create an offer
- Payment (Stripe)
